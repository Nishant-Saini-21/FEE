    <center>
    <h2 style="font-size: 27px; color:aliceblue  ">  Admittedly, this has become a bit of a controversial series, both because of the books themselves, but also because of the subsequent development of the Harry Potter brand.  Please note the following.  First, we take the books as we find them on the shelf.  Second, our review of Harry Potter does not in any way indicate our views of any related sequels (in book or film form), which some avid Potter fans justifiably view as too dark and explicitly intertwined with the occult.  Are we surprised that the powers of the purse may have twisted a good thing? 
    <br><br>
    All that aside, enjoy this review by Mr. Joe Breslin.
    <br><br>
    J.K. Rowling’s seven-book Harry Potter series deserves every bit of its historic success, but I was the last person on earth to discover it. Having read the first three novels in my teens,  I somehow put them aside and went on to other things. What an unexpected surprise it was to read all seven for the first time as an adult, and to be dying to discuss this scene or that moment with anyone who would listen. Naturally, I’ve recently been subjected to many versions of,  “Wait! You mean this is the first time you’ve read them all?!”
    <br>
    But how to review a series with so many important secrets and twists, including some, the premature revelation of which could only be justly punished by burning at the stake? Indeed, I am greatly indebted to decades worth of discrete readers who never spoiled the books for me. On the other hand, so many know the story that a review might seem superfluous. There appears to be only one way to go about it, and that is to attempt to approach the series through some of its most defining themes. Without plot-spoilers, I offer the reader eight elements that set this series apart from other contemporary fantasy series: characters, gravity, the question of trust, excellent plotting, powerful moments, war and the question of death, the natures of good and evil, and the triumph of agape love. At the end I will briefly address a few of common criticisms.
<br></h2></center>

<center>
<h1 style="font-size: 57px; color:aliceblue  ">Characters</h1>
        <h2 style="font-size: 27px; color:aliceblue  ">
    Rowling invests each of her characters with a delightful individuality, a vitality in speech, appearance, and behavior that makes them leap off the page as three-dimensional beings. Though at first a bit caricature-like, they deepen as the stories deepen, becoming our old friends. There seemed something Dahlish or Dickensish about her characterization, yet at the same time it feels very original, very modern. How does she achieve this classic/contemporary feel? I really don’t know.
    
    <br>

    What’s interesting is that this lively characterization applies not only to the handful of main characters, but to second- and third-tier characters, and even to characters who appear only in flashback. Like a skilled chef, Rowling knows how to add just the right ingredients, and just enough seasoning to achieve very distinct flavors, and she lets these play off each other, enriching and defining the experience over time.
    
    <br>

    Interestingly, Harry’s personality is less immediately distinctive, taking all seven books to develop. This is partly a function of the demands of the narrative. Harry remains, for the reader, the outsider continually stepping through the magic door. There are times when Harry’s actions seem erratic, unpredictable, or unjust. In the fifth book, he’s often infuriating and obnoxious. Dumbledore praises Harry’s bravery, but Potter is at least as rash as he is brave. One begins to suspect that Snape may not be wholly unjustified in his dislike for Harry. In another author’s hands, this might indicate uneven characterization, but at length it becomes clear that Harry’s unevenness is just like that of a real boy, muddling through those confusing years from late boyhood to late youth. He’s not yet a white knight, but he’s heading in the right direction. Indeed, it’s part of the series’ strength that, in some sense, Harry himself is not really the center of everything. Precisely because Harry has a kind of destiny or vocation to greatness, his personal choices to accept the weight of that destiny, rather than his personality or his individual quirks, are what really matter to the story’s resolution.
    
    <br>

    The third book introduces characters who are morally complex, and who the reader senses will need to make some hard choices of their own if they wish to remain on the side of good. It’s not that good or evil are muddy or unclear, but rather that some good characters are only “goodish,” and will have to become better. Likewise, the progress of the series reveals that some evil characters may yet have a chance at redemption.
    
    <br>

    Among the most distinct and enduring of Rowling’s characters is Albus Dumbledore. Every scene he’s in pulses with energy, and even offstage, the weight of his presence is everywhere. In Dumbledore, Rowling gives us a character who seems every bit as formidable as his reputation within the narrative suggests, and yet human for all that. We love this character, and come to rely on him just as Harry does. In many ways, benevolent old Dumbledore acts as the moral compass of the series, and so it is with some trepidation that we begin to detect tension between him and the established powers of good. This tension explodes in a verbal confrontation at the end of the fourth book, a confrontation that marks the definitive shift from something that is largely a children’s series, to a story that feels a great deal more weighty</h2>

<h1 style="font-size: 55px; color:aliceblue  ">  Discussion Questions </h1>
</center>
<center>
 <b style="font-size: 27px; color:aliceblue "></h2>To lie means to deliberately communicate as true something we know to be contrary to the truth. Can you think of a situation where Harry lied because he couldn’t be frank with his questioner? How could he have avoided lying in this situation?
    Why do you think Harry tends to rely on himself, and on his own judgment?
    Are there ways Harry and Voldemort are similar? What really makes them different?
    In the later books, Harry eventually faces the choice of trusting without being able to know all the facts. Given that people are fallible and imperfect, how can we be justified in placing our trust in them?
    What would be the cost of refusing to trust anyone but oneself?
    Aside from Harry, who is the real hero(ine) of the Harry Potter series?
    Was there a moment in the series that you found particularly funny, sad, frightening, or moving?
    Are there cases in real life where believing a thing actually makes it true, or more likely to become true?
